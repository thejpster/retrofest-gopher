HP 9000 B132L+
==============

This Hewlett Packard Visualize B132L+ (from the 'B-series' family)
is a mid-range single-processor 32-bit UNIX workstation, from 1996.

HP launched the HP 9000 series in 1984, and initially used a range
of processor architectures, before settling on HP's own PA-RISC
architecture. The array of machines in the line-up is dizzying, but
broadly there were servers and there were workstations. The HP 9000
Series 700 workstations are perhaps the best known, partly because
they also had a port of NeXTSTEP OS. HP gave up on numbers in 1995,
and replaced the 700-series workstations with the Visualize
B-series, C-series and J-series workstations. B-Series that we have
was available at 132 MHz (our example), 160 MHz (the B160L) and 180
MHz (the B180L) variants, with a choice of standard SCSI or
high-voltage differential SCSI (you don't want that one). It has
integrated 2D graphics, and so it a middling UNIX workstation,
rather than a fire-breathing graphics powerhouse. It has six 72-pin
SIMM slots and takes ECC RAM.

This example was actually a server for Cable and Wireless and only
came out of service recently. The video output has a 'VESA EVC' and
the vendor thankfully included a VGA adapter.

It is running HP-UX 10.20 from 1996, which is probably what our
machine should have shipped with. HP-UX 10.20 came with both VUE
and its replacement CDE. I've elected to install the former,
because we've already got a few CDE machines and well, I mean just
look at those strakes on the launcher panel!
