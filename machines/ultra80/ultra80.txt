Sun Ultra 80
============

This Sun Ultra 80 is a high-end 64-bit multi-processor UNIX workstation
from 1999.

This is the top of Sun's workstation line-up from the late 1990's, and can take
up to four UltraSPARC-II CPU modules. In this machine, we have three (the fourth
is not working and has been removed). This model was replaced by the Ultra 45 in
2006 (which was the last SPARC workstation Sun ever made).

Inside, there are 16x 144-pin DIMM slots which take ECC SDRAM. The maximum
capacity is 4GB. Unfortunately, half the DIMM slots are on a riser board which
is supported on a plastic frame (as are the CPUs) and this plastic is now
incredibly prone to cracking. I really hope it surives the journey as that
plastic is carrying quite a lot of weight. I much prefer the interior design of
the HP Visualize C3000 (which would have been a direct competitor), as that has
all-metal construction.

This example is fitted with a 2D graphics card, and the stickers on the case
indicate it came from Oxford University Computing Laboratory. I like to think it
was used for C programming and maybe some mathematical modelling in MATLAB.

This machine would have shipped with Sun Solaris 7, which was the first 64-bit
version of Solaris and is what I have installed. Solaris 7 came with either
OpenWindows or the Common Desktop Environment (CDE). It is also supported by
Solaris 8, 9 and 10.
