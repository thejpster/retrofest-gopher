HP 9000 Visualize C3000
=======================

This HP 9000 Visualize C3000 (from the 'C-series' family) is a high-end
single-processor 64-bit UNIX workstation from 1999.

Our C3000 is a later model than the B132L+, sporting a 64-bit PA-8500 processor,
a couple of 64-bit/66 MHz PCI slots, and eight non-standard 278-pin DIMM slots
that take 120 MHz ECC SDRAM modules. It would have been a direct competitor for
our Sun Ultra 80.

This example was actually a server for Virgin Media and only came out of service
recently. A 3D graphics card was added by the vendor so I wouldn't be forced to
use the serial console.

It is running HP-UX 11.00 from 1996, which is probably what our machine
should have shipped with and is the first 64-bit version of HP-UX. HP-UX
11.00 came with only the Common Desktop Environment (CDE).
