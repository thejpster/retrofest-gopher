Silicon Graphics POWER Indigo 2
===============================

This Silicon Graphics POWER Indigo 2 is a high-end 64-bit
single-processor UNIX workstation from 1994.

The Indigo 2, launched in 1992, was the replacement for the 1991's
Indigo and was Silicon Graphic's mid-range single-processor desktop
workstation. It launched with the first mainstream 64-bit processor
- the MIPS R4000 - in the distinctive teal coloured case you see
here. Later models could be ordered with a MIPS R4400 processor,
which had larger caches and higher clockspeeds. These early models
came with a choice of three graphics cards:

* XL Graphics - 1280x1024 at 76 Hz in 24-bit colour. Mostly a 2D
card - any 3D calculations would be handled by your CPU.
* XZ Graphics - the one I have. Comes on two full-length PCBs and
includes two (later four) Geometry Engines that each give 32 MFLOPs
and 250,000 triangles per second. They are joined by a Raster
Engine processor and a Command Engine processor but, notably, there
is no hardware Texture Mapping. Will it play GLQuake? No. Well,
maybe, but all the walls would be flat colours. It's designed to do
CAD
* Extreme Graphics - the top-of-the-line option, coming on three
PCBs. You get eight Geometry Engines giving you 256 MFLOPs. Still
no hardware texture-mapping though.

Video output on all three options is using a 13W3 connector, and so
to use a VGA monitor you require an adapter.

The R4400 was OK, but MIPS (which was bought out by Silicon
Graphics in 1992) was worried that it was getting beaten by its
competition (Alpha, PA-RISC, HyperSPARC, etc), especially in
floating point calculations. Their answer to this was the MIPS
R8000, launched in June 1994. Despite clocking at only 75 MHz, its
wide architecture allowed it to perform up to 300 million
floating-point instructions per second (MFLOPS). This CPU was so
powerful, SGI claimed that, with the same processor count, an R8000
machine had the same performance as a Cray Y-MP supercomputer from
1988. The price for this performance was steep, although was
perhaps very reasonable compared to the price of a Cray. The CPU
alone cost $2,5000, never mind the rest of the computer. This is
(at least partly) because instead of being a single ceramic
package, the CPU is in fact an A5-sized PCB covered in many large
(and hot) ICs. It worked though, and by November 1994 (less than
six months after launch), 50 of the world's Top 500 fastest
computers were SGI POWER Challenge or SGI POWER Onyx servers using
the R8000 processor. Looking at the list, the lowest placed POWER
Challenge was in position 439 and was a six-processor machine owned
by Volvo. As it happened, SGI ended up buying Cray in 1996.

Naturally, computers have moved on somewhat in the last ~30 years,
and the R8000 is out-performed (but not outclassed) by the ARM11
CPU you get on a $10 Raspberry Pi Zero.

The Indigo 2 was, for a short time and at an extraordinary price
tag, available with a single instance of this the super-computer
grade CPU. An R8000-equipped Indigo 2 is known in the marketing
material as a "POWER Indigo 2", and that is what we have here. The
short life-span of the POWER Indigo 2 was because the MIPS R10K
arrived in January 1996, compensating for its lowly
two-instructions-per-clock cycle FPU performance by having more
than twice the clock speed of the R8000, and at a much lower price
point. At about the same time as the R10K came out, the graphics
sub-system in the Indigo 2 was upgraded from EXTREME Graphics to
IMPACT Graphics, and the case colour was changed from teal to
purple to mark this upgrade.

The Centre for Computing History has many things in its archive,
but it does not (last I checked) have a POWER Indigo 2. SGI Depot
is perhaps the primary on-line resource for SGI spare parts and
complete machines, and Ian there tells me he doesn't have a POWER
Indigo 2 either. If he did have one to sell you, his price list
says it'd cost you Â£1400. That's a lot, but it's also still a
steep discount on the original list price of $75,000.

I have no information about the history of this particular example,
other than I acquired it from a lovely person called Kestral who I
met on social media.

This POWER Indigo 2 is running IRIX 6.2 from 1996, which is a
little bit later than our machine (which would have shipped with
IRIX 6.0), but a reasonable in-period upgrade.
